Peer-block enforcement helpers.

A ``UserBlock`` is one-directional in storage but enforced *symmetrically*: once
A blocks B, neither should encounter the other on any surface (Drops, Sparks,
event connections). Centralising the symmetric ``Q(...) | Q(...)`` here keeps it
out of every call site and matches the ``existing_connection_subq`` idiom already
used in ``services.crush_connect``.
